    <p>My hobbies and interests include the following.</p>
    <h3>3D Design</h3>
     <p>I have studied Maya 3D for quite some time and I enjoy making 3D assets.</p>
    <h3>Gaming</h3>
     <p>I've been playing video games for most of my life,
        I mainly play FPS games and other shooters but recently I have been playing Chivalry II.
     </p>
    <h3>Music</h3>
     <p>I listen to quite a lot of music genres but the main one I listen to is rock.</p>
    <h3>Animation</h3>
     <p>During my time at college I was taught how to animate.
         In the future I would like to learn more techniques and create some short films.</p>
